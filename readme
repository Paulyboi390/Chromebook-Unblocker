Securly Unblocker via Custom DNS on Chromebooks
This uses NextDNS.io to block securly.com domains so Securly may fail to load cloud-based rules or log activity properly. It works inconsistently on school Chromebooks — often only partially or not at all due to management policies and Securly fallbacks.
Important Notes

NextDNS free tier: up to 300,000 queries/month.
School-managed Chromebooks often disable custom Secure DNS or reset changes automatically.
Powerwashing wipes local settings; school extensions and policies reload on sign-in.
Results vary widely — full unblocking is rare; partial disruption of Securly is more common.

Full Step-by-Step Guide (Easiest Secure DNS Method First)

Set Up NextDNS (Do this on any device/browser)
Go to https://nextdns.io
Sign up free (just email + password — no card needed)
It creates a config automatically
Go to Denylist
Add this line:
securly.com
Click Save
Get Your DoH URL
Go to the Setup tab
Scroll to DNS-over-HTTPS
Copy the full URL that looks like: https://dns.nextdns.io/abc123 (abc123 is your unique ID — keep it private)


Enable Secure DNS on the Chromebook (Easiest method but may not show up all the time)
Open Chrome
In the address bar type: chrome://settings/security and press Enter
Scroll to Use secure DNS
Turn the toggle ON
Change from "With your current service provider" to With → Custom
Paste your NextDNS DoH URL: https://dns.nextdns.io/abc123
Hit Enter / Apply
Done — it starts working immediately (no restart needed)
If you see "This setting is disabled on managed browsers" → school policy blocks it and this won’t work.

Optional Fallback: Plain DNS on Wi-Fi (if DoH is blocked)
Clock (bottom right) → Settings gear
Go to Network → click your connected Wi-Fi
Click Network
Find Name servers → change to Custom name servers
Paste your NextDNS IPv4 addresses (found on the Setup page, usually two like 45.90.28.0 and 45.90.30.0)
Save
(Note: DoH is much harder for schools to block, so try that first.)

Get Your Wi-Fi Password BEFORE Powerwash (So You Can Connect After Reset)
While still signed in and connected to Wi-Fi, open Chrome
Type chrome://sync-internals in the address bar and press Enter
Click the Search tab at the top
In the search box, type "wifi" → hit Search
Look for the entry with your network's passphrase (the long random string of letters and numbers)
Copy that entire encrypted string
To turn it into your real Wi-Fi password:
Open the file called wifipassword.html
Paste the encrypted string into the box on the page
Click Get Wifi Password
It will show your actual Wi-Fi password

Write it down or save it somewhere safe (like your phone notes) so you can use it during setup after powerwash
(Note: This only works if Wi-Fi networks were synced to your Google account before. If nothing useful shows up, you'll need the password another way.)

Powerwash (90% of the time this is manditory)
Turn off the Chromebook completely
Hold down Esc + Refresh (the circle arrow key) + Power button at the same time
Release Power when it starts; keep holding Esc + Refresh until you see the yellow recovery screen
Select Powerwash → Continue → confirm the wipe
It will restart and wipe everything

After Powerwash
Connect to Wi-Fi using the password you saved from step 4
Sign in with your school Google account
As soon as you’re logged in, go straight back to: chrome://settings/security
Check if Use secure DNS is still ON with your NextDNS URL
If it got reset or disabled → quickly redo step 2 (if the setting is still available)
Note: Secure DNS does not sync through your Google account on managed devices — you must set it again after sign-in.

Test It
Open a new tab and go to: https://securly.com or https://logs.securly.com → It should fail to load (DNS error like NXDOMAIN or timeout)
Go to https://test.nextdns.io → it should show your config and blocked domains
Try some normally blocked sites (YouTube, games, etc.) — see if Securly lets them through because it can’t reach its servers
Check your NextDNS dashboard (my.nextdns.io) — look for blocked queries from securly.com
