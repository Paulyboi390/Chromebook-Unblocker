Securly Unblocker via Custom DNS on Chromebooks
This uses NextDNS.io to block securly.com so Securly can't load or enforce rules. It works on many school Chromebooks—might fully unblock sites, or at least hide your browsing from teachers/admins.
Important Notes Before Starting:

NextDNS is free for basic use (up to 300,000 queries/month).
School policies might override DNS or use a forced Chrome extension—results vary.
Powerwashing deletes local files/settings/apps, but school stuff reloads on sign-in.
At your own risk—schools might detect changes.

Step-by-Step Guide

Set Up Your Custom DNS with NextDNS.io and Get Your DoH URL
Go to https://nextdns.io/ (use any browser, even on your phone).
Sign up free (email + password—no card needed).
It auto-creates a config—rename it if you want (e.g., "School Block").
Go to the Denylist (or blocklist) section.
Add: securly.com
Add: *.securly.com (blocks all subdomains like logs.securly.com)

Save.
Now get your DoH URL (this is the secure/encrypted one Chrome loves):
Go to the Setup tab (or main dashboard).
Scroll to DNS-over-HTTPS section.
You'll see something like: https://dns.nextdns.io/abc123 (the "abc123" is your unique ID—don't share it!).
Copy that full URL (it might say "Append the name..." but you can use the base one without extras for now).
If it shows IPv4 addresses too (like 45.90.xx.xx), note them as backup, but prioritize the DoH URL.


Change DNS Settings on Your Chromebook (Optional fallback—DoH in next step is better)
Click clock bottom right → gear icon (Settings).
Click Network → your Wi-Fi name.
“Name servers” → switch to Custom name servers.
Primary/Secondary: paste your NextDNS IPv4 addresses from Setup page.
Save. (But skip if using DoH below—it overrides this nicely.)

Enable Secure DNS with Your DoH URL and Sync to Google Account (Required)
In Settings → Privacy and security → Security.
Turn ON Use secure DNS.
Select With → Custom (or "Enter custom provider").
Paste your full DoH URL from Step 1.
This encrypts DNS queries and applies your blocklist reliably.

Now sync it to your Google account so it sticks better (especially after powerwash):
Go to Sync and Google services (under your account name or Privacy section).
Turn Sync ON.
Choose Sync everything (or at least include "Settings" / "Other stuff"—this syncs browser privacy settings like Secure DNS across sign-ins and devices).

Why? Chrome syncs the Secure DNS choice via your Google account, so it reapplies automatically when you sign back in after reset.

Powerwash the Chromebook
Turn it off completely.
Hold Esc + Refresh (circle arrow key) + Power all at once.
Release Power when it starts, keep holding Esc + Refresh.
On yellow exclamation/recovery screen, follow to Powerwash/reset.
Confirm—let it wipe and reboot.

Set It Up Again
Connect to Wi-Fi, enter password.
Sign in with school Google account.
Sync should pull your Secure DNS + DoH URL automatically (check in Settings > Privacy and security > Security to confirm it's still on with your NextDNS URL).
If it didn't sync or got reset, quickly redo Step 3 right away.
Test a blocked site fast—Securly should be blocked/failed.
